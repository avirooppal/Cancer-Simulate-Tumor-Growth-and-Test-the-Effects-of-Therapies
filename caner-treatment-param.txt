Key Parameters and Health Metrics
Age:
Patients must generally be adults (18 years or older).
Sex:
Gender may influence eligibility based on specific cancer types and treatments.
Medical History:
Prior Treatments: Information about previous cancer therapies received, including types and outcomes.
Concurrent Malignancies: Presence of other active cancers can affect eligibility.
Current Health Status:
Performance Status: Assessment of the patient's overall health and ability to perform daily activities, often measured using scales like the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status.
Organ Function: Adequate function of vital organs is essential, typically assessed by:
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1,500 cells/mm続
Platelets > 100,000 cells/mm続
Total Bilirubin < 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) < 2.5 to 3 times ULN
Creatinine < 1.5 times ULN or creatinine clearance > 60 mL/min.
Disease Characteristics:
Type of Cancer: Specific cancer types are critical in determining treatment eligibility.
Stage of Cancer: The stage can dictate whether a patient is suitable for certain treatments.
Measurable Disease: For certain studies, patients must have measurable or evaluable disease to assess treatment response.
Comorbid Conditions:
Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular diseases) may exclude patients from trials due to increased risk during treatment.
Laboratory Test Results:
Recent laboratory tests confirming adequate organ function and other health metrics are required.
Vital Signs:
Monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature to ensure stability.
Nutritional Status:
Assessment of weight loss or malnutrition that may affect treatment tolerance.
Psychosocial Factors:
Evaluation of mental health status and support systems that may impact treatment adherence and outcomes.,,Health Metrics for Laboratory Test Results
Complete Blood Count (CBC):
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): Must be > 1,500 cells/mm続.
Platelet Count: Must be > 100,000 cells/mm続.
Hemoglobin Levels: Important for assessing anemia.
Liver Function Tests:
Total Bilirubin: Must be < 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) / Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): Must be < 2.5 to 3 times ULN.
Renal Function Tests:
Creatinine Levels: Must be < 1.5 times ULN or creatinine clearance must be > 60 mL/min.
Electrolyte Levels:
Monitoring of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium to ensure metabolic stability.
Tumor Markers:
Specific markers relevant to the type of cancer being treated (e.g., Alpha-fetoprotein for liver cancer, CA-125 for ovarian cancer).
Coagulation Profile:
Assessing parameters like prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to evaluate bleeding risk.
Serum Protein Levels:
Including albumin levels, which can indicate nutritional status and liver function.
Immunoglobulin Levels:
Useful in assessing conditions like multiple myeloma.
Other Specific Tests:
Depending on the type of cancer, additional tests may include hormone levels (e.g., beta-human chorionic gonadotropin for germ cell tumors) and specific biomarkers related to the disease.
